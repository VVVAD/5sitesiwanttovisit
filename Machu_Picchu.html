                    Inca city in the Cusco Region of Peru, located 2,430 meters (7,970 ft) above sea level. The city was
                    built around 1450 and abandoned 100 years later, at the time of the Spanish conquest.<br> It was
                    rediscovered in 1911 by American explorer Hiram Bingham.
                    Machu Picchu is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, and is one
                    of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The city is known for its dry-stone walls, terraces, and
                    temples, all of which were built without the use of mortar.
                    The exact purpose of Machu Picchu is still unknown, but it is believed to have been a royal estate
                    or religious center. The city is located in a cloud forest, and is surrounded by mountains and the
                    Urubamba River.<br>
                    Machu Picchu is a popular tourist destination, and is visited by over a million people each year.
                    The city can be reached by train or by foot, and there are a number of different hikes that visitors
                    can take.
